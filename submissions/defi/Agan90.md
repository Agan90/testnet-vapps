## Category

## Application Description
DeFiBridge is a decentralized bridging application that connects 
various DeFi protocols across different networks with a strong emphasis 
on privacy. It enables users to transfer and swap assets across 
protocols securely, without revealing sensitive data, by leveraging 
Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP) technology.
## Technology Stack
- zkVM - TypeScript (frontend) - Node.js (backend) - PostgreSQL 
(optional, for local data tracking)
## How the Application Will Interact with the Soundness Layer
DeFiBridge will utilize the Soundness Layer to store and verify 
Zero-Knowledge proofs generated during cross-protocol operations. These 
proofs ensure that the transaction data has been cryptographically 
verified without exposing any raw information on-chain, enhancing both 
privacy and efficiency.
## Timeline (Estimated Development Milestones)
- **Week 1:** Research and design the application architecture
- **Week 2â€“3:** Develop the initial prototype and UI/UX interface
- **Week 4:** Integrate with the Soundness Layer (ZK proof storage & verification)
- **Week 5:** Conduct end-to-end testing and simulate cross-protocol operations 
- **Week 6:** Deploy to testnet and gather user feedback 
- **Week 7:** Iterate based on feedback and finalize documentation
