identity

## Description  
This vApp aims to provide a secure and decentralized identity verification system. Users will be able to verify their identities through a blockchain-based method that ensures privacy and tamper-proof credentials. The app will allow other dApps to query verified identities reliably.

## Technical Architecture  
The application will be developed using React for the frontend. The backend will integrate with the Soundness Layer for verifiable proofs of identity. User credentials will be stored securely, and zero-knowledge proofs will be used to validate identities without revealing sensitive data.

## Development Timeline  
The Proof-of-Concept (PoC) is expected to be completed within 1 month from the start date. Initial focus will be on frontend interface and integration with Soundness Layerâ€™s verification protocols.

## Additional Notes  
The repository for this vApp is currently under development and will be shared once ready.
